For CHR2024, I was very lucky to be accepted for a lightning talk to present an ongoing collaboration that I've been working on with Daniel Evans. Unfortunately, the talks are only 5 minutes long and I currently have Covid, so what I recorded was a bit scattered. To help make sense of it, I've written up in a bit more detail what I was trying to say in the talk and also where we are in the project. If you have any suggestions or questions, please feel free to reach out!
