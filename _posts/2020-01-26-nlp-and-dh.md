description: Notes and slides for recent talk

For Princeton's Research Data Management Workshop for graduate students this Winter, I put together a more meta-level talk about natural language processing and digital humanities. The talk introduces a few tools and terms, but more broadly tries to introduce graduate students to the types of questions and processes that exist for doing this type of research. You can see the full text of the talk [here](https://www.notion.so/Natural-Language-Processing-and-Digital-Humanities-6da7c69f6b0645f189a0d3a81481defb) and the slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19p1puwByQgYgJALBxcjudxMWPguQrWRUBND0Ef8uzS4/edit?usp=sharing).

As always, I welcome any feedback and feel free to reuse my talk (though let me know since I would love to hear how it goes!)
