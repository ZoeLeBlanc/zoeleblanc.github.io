This project grew out of my dissertation research and my realization that I was not utilizing a lot of the images in the newspapers and magazines I was studying. With this project, I am trying to use digital image analysis methods to trace how the symbolism of anti-colonization shifted throughout my period of study. I'm particularly interested in exploring which photographs traveled across anti-colonial media networks, and images were used to represent shifting political agendas. 

You can read more about my initial foray into these methods in my post of [my SHAFR 2017 conference talk]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2017/depictions-of-decolonization-shafr-2017/).
