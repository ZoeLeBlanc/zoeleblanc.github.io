This project was my first foray into using digital history methods in my research. Prior to this project, I had mostly been interested in digital pedagogy, but after some encouragement from Micki Kaufman (whose work is amazing and if you're not familiar with it, check out her project [Quantifying Kissinger](http://blog.quantifyingkissinger.com/)) I decided to delve into some text analysis methods.

I initially started with just organizing my materials, which you can see here.

Then I used a combination of David McClure's Textplot, Voyant's Principal Components Analysis, AntConc, Mallet, and OverviewDocs to explore how words in the documents clustered and co-located. 

At the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations Conference in 2015, I presented some early findings, and talked about how this helped me identify anti-colonial meanings in my sources.

After the conference, I set up a website for the project, and you can read more [here](http://zoeleblanc.com/dispatchesfromcairo/).

I plan to continue analyzing these materials and updating my findings, as well as delving into statistics to further refine the models I'm using on my textual sources.
