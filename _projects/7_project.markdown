Harry Potter Game

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/harrypotter1.png" id="project_img" />

Game built using prototypal inheritance in Javascript and JQuery with Grunt and Browersify. Convinced my teammates to make it Harry Potter theme after I got a hedgehog as my patronus on Pottermore.

Users get sorted into Hogwart Houses and can select a patronus.

They then can battle Voldemort and the Death Eaters, using spells and getting help from magical friends.

You can play the game [here](http://zoeleblanc.com/hogwarts-game/) or check out the github repo [here](https://github.com/ZoeLeBlanc/hogwarts-game)

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/freddy_v_json.gif" id="project_img" />

A movie rating and saving app built in Javascript and JQuery with Materialize. You can search for movies using the OMDB API, and save them and rate them.

You can create an account and try it out [here](https://freddy-vs-json.firebaseapp.com/), or view the github repo [here](https://github.com/ZoeLeBlanc/movie-history-freddie-vs-json).

NSS Cohort 16 Website

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cohort16pro.png" id="project_img" />

Built the majority of my cohort's website in Javascript, JQuery, Materialize, and Grunt. Came up with the theme of having a professional version and then switching to Sweet 16 Party mode on a button click.
