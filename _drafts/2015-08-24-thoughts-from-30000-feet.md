A few thoughts from one of my flights somewhere above the Eastern Seaboard.
1. Getting a seat with no one next to you is the flying equivalent of getting ice cream as a kid.
2. Flying through big white puffy clouds always reminds me of the first scenes of cloud city in the Empire Strikes Back.
3. Hierarchy of drinks is as follows: any free alcohol, any free hot drink, gingerale, diet coke, club soda, and lastly, water.
