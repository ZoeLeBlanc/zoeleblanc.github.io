        </div>
        <h6>I'm an aspiring digital historian and web developer. Currently, I'm finishing my Ph.D. in History at Vanderbilt University, and the software developer program at the Nashville Software School.</h6>

        <p>From a 30,000 view, my interests today cluster around exploring how we produce and disseminate new knowledge, and thinking about how to create new ways to create and share research. 
        </p>
        <p>At Vanderbilt, my training has largely focused on the fields of </p>

        My interests range far and wide: 
        I'm interested in

           specialize in American, Middle Eastern, and North African histories, and consider myself an international historian. I like thinking about race and religion, especially from the perspective of institutions and states. 

          Things that fascinate me (in no particular order):
          * The resurgence of religion in the second half of the twentieth century across the globe
          * The relationship(s) between states and social movements
          * The power of ideas and ideologies to naturalize and denaturalize 
          * The relationship(s) between space and time for constituting place
          * The rise of 'health' as a discourse in the second half of the twentieth century
          * The use of probablistic statistics to understand historical discourses and events
          * The relationship(s) between local, national, and international
          * The potential for technology to augment historical research
        </p>

          These are all the topics I can think of at the moment, but there's many more questions that I like to spend my day stewing over. 

          At the moment, I'm a Canadian expat who is lucky enough to call Nashville, TN home while I complete my doctorate in history at Vanderbilt Univeristy. 

          Some of things I'm working on at the moment include:

          * Researching my dissertation
          * Improving my programming skills (specifically python and ruby)
          * Building websites
          * Practicing Arabic 
          * Learning how to build deep maps
          * Thinking about digital pedagogy

          Feel free to drop me a line via twitter or my contact page, and I'll try and get back to you quickly. I'm happy to talk about my research, potential collaborations, or the virtues of ice cream and nutella. 



          Zoe LeBlanc is a Doctoral Candidate in the Department of History at Vanderbilt University. Her dissertation is tentatively titled, “Constructing Anti-Colonial Cairo: the United Arab Republic’s role in Anti-Colonial Movements during the Cold War”, and examines the emergence of Cairo as a hub for anti-colonial activism in Africa in the wake of decolonization and the escalation of the Cold War in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
