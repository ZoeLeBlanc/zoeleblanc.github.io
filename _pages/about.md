Hi! I'm Zoe.

I‚Äôm¬†currently¬†a  Postdoctoral Associate and Weld Fellow at the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University. I received my Ph.D. in History at Vanderbilt University in August 2019. My dissertation, "Circulating Anti-Colonial Cairo: Decolonizing Information and Constructing the Third World in Egypt, 1952-1966", is the first digital history dissertation at Vanderbilt, and throughout my chapters I use computational methods to analyze archival sources and craft historical arguments. My research looks at how Egypt in the 1950s and 60s became a leader among decolonizing states, and specifically how Cairo became a hub for both anti-colonial movements and media circulated to the rest of the Third World. I'm particularly interested in how ideas about information and modernity became implicated in Egypt's effort to build a global anti-colonial political community. I'm currently working on developing my dissertation into a digital publication that will allow readers to explore the construction of the Third World both historically and computationally.

In addition to my work as a historian of international movements and information, I am also passionate about integrating computational methods into historical research.  During my dissertation, I built new tools for digitizing archival sources, and utilized a combination of natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning to compile my datasets and analyze them. I am currently working on an article that explores how the shift from archival sources to datasets is transforming historical research. For more information, please click here

Previously I worked as a Digital Humanities Developer at the Scholars' Lab, UVA from 2017 to 2019. In this position, I was responsible for building web applications for mapping and data visualization in the humanities. I was also part of a multi-institutional team to harmonize data from HathiTrust, JStor, and Portico for humanities' text data analysis. In addition to these projects, I consulted with and taught undergraduate students, graduate fellows, and faculty at UVA and beyond on machine learning and statistical modeling, data visualization and network analysis, and building databases and websites. In the Fall 2018, I also developed and piloted an intensive programming course for graduate fellows at the Scholars' Lab, which you can find on Github



I'm also entering my final year as a <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/history/bio/zoe-leblanc">doctoral candidate in history at Vanderbilt University </a>. My dissertation, ‚ÄúCirculating Anti-Colonial Cairo‚Äù, is about Cairo‚Äôs role as a hub for international anti-colonial movements and anti-colonial media production. I explore how the establishment of the Middle East News Agency in Cairo in 1955 was a vehicle for the UAR to present a counter narrative to the perceived biased coverage from Western press agencies. I trace how the discourses and imagery in Cairo print media changed from 1948 and the early revolution to the late 1960s and early 1970s as Egypt transitioned away from the socialism of the Nasserist era. Ultimately, I argue that anti-colonialism was both locally constructed and deeply enmeshed in international debates over the future of decolonization. I work primarily in print newspapers and periodicals from Cairo and other Third World capitals, as well diplomatic cables from Western embassies in Cairo and Western newspapers. Under the hood of the project, I rely on a web app I built to manage my data, and extract text and images from my archival research. I also utilize statistical models, machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision algorithms to understand how discourses and symbolism in these sources changed over time.
