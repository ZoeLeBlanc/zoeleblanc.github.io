Hi! I'm Zoe.

I‚Äôm¬†currently¬†an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research sits at the intersection of histories of information and digital humanities. In my scholarship and teaching, I explore how, through the lens of information, knowledge and power have been produced over time (especially in relation to liberation politics), and connect this perspective to contemporary debates over data and society, as well as the use (and misuse) of digital methods in the humanities. I am particularly interested in weaving together critical and historical analysis of our digital moment, along with experimenting and developing the future of knowledge production. To put it succinctly, I am fascinated with the questions of how does information organize our world, and how can we build this to be more equitable and liberatory in the future.

Previously, I was the Postdoctoral Associate and Weld Fellow at the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University. I also received my Ph.D. in History at Vanderbilt University in August 2019 and was a Digital Humanities Developer at the Scholars' Lab, University of Virginia, where I was responsible for building web applications for mapping and data visualization in the humanities.

I am currently working on a number of digital projects and publications, and am happy to discuss these or potential collaborations.

Hope you say hi back üëãüèΩ!
