Panelist on the roundtable, "The Future is Now: Lessons Learned from 3 Digital Dissertations in History", where I'll be presenting the digital component of my dissertation. I'll be discussing the possibilities and practicalities of digital history dissertations. Also discuss the difficulties in learning digital history methods, with planning and executing a digital dissertation, and how I translated different disciplines' methodologies (natural language processing, computer vision, and web app development) to my dissertation committee.

More information forthcoming.
