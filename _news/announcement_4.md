I graduated from the full stack Nashville Software School this past Spring. I'll be writing about my experience soon but here's a small write up on the [school's blog](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/blog/2017/05/08/coding-your-passions).

Overall, really enjoyed the experienced and was surprised to be awarded the :sparkles: Catalyst award for best all around developer for both the frontend and backend portions :blush:
