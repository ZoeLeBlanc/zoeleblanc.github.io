Panelist on the roundtable on digital history dissertations, where I'll be discussing the possibilities and practicalities of digital history dissertations. Also discuss the difficulties in learning digital history methods, with planning and executing a digital dissertation, and how I translated different disciplines' methodologies (natural language processing, computer vision, and web app development) to my dissertation committee.

More information forthcoming.
